# beest

Beest is a simple 2D Java game with randomly generated levels, designed with efficiency, easily readable code, and best programming 
practices in mind. 

The object of the game is to survive as long as you can, by using the black boxes provided to you to crush the red "Beests". Each round
there will be less and less boxes, and more and more Beests, so it gets crazy quick! 

Enjoy :)
